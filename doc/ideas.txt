OpenCL Image Toolkit - Ideas draftbook

* Node chain
  - Everything is a node
  - Every node is connected to 0/1 input nodes and 0/1 output nodes (a pipeline)
  - Nodes with 0 inputs (only first node) upload data from disk to VRAM
  - Nodes with 0 outputs (only last node) download data from VRAM to disk
  - One can specify subrange of active nodes (via "breakpoints" or "pipeline-stop" points)
    - Only one breakpoint can be set as "current" at a time
    - At everu recomputation pipeline is restarted at current breakpoint and continues
      to next breakpoint or pipeline end.
    - At each breakpoint a render event is triggered (can be explicitly disabled).
    - Example: (|1| denotes breakpoint, |!1| denotes breakpoint with disabled rendering)
      Import (load file) -> |!1| -> Desaturate -> Blur -> |2| -> Export (save file)
      1. At first Import node is processed, it loads file from disk then #1 is reached.
      2. #1 is made current so pipeline continue from #1 to #2 at each recomputation
         (at this point user tweaks parameters and works with the program)
      3. When save to disk is desired #2 is made current and export proceedes.
  - Node data exchange: arbitrary number of PBOs and one special "register PBO"
    - Two main PBOs (input and output PBO)
      - Swapped as pipeline progresses (one node output becomes next node input)
    - Dynamic number of auxiliary PBOs
      - Sequentially allocated on-demand when pipeline is modified
        Example: user adds new node, that node needs special buffer, a buffer of
                 next free ID is given to that buffer.
      - Deallocated and marked as free on node removal.
      - Example of aux buffer: histogram data
    - Special register PBO
      - 65536 ints, 65536 floats for reading/writing simple values
      - Standard locations for common data by known index values (via #defines)
      - Can be used to pass arguments from one node to the next
    - Explicit data conversion nodes
      - For example: RGB <-> float or image dimension change
      - Very costly as involved PBOs need to be reinitialized - should be avoided!
      - Best practice: Place between breakpoints so it's a one time operation.
